# Combat

For Combat, your limited to initially 10 cards total before having to shuffle the deck. And three cards in your hand.
Once you play a card, you pull a card from the deck. At the end of the 10 cards, you have to play everything in your hand.

Currently the **Card Archetypes** are As Follows
- Fire
- Acid
- Light

We would like to purposefully scale the enemy to only really last three turns before dieing as to not make the game drawn out.
To add some depth to the combat though, we would like to do some simple things when creating the combat creatures
- Making some Creatures resistant to certain attacks. IE, a skeleton is resistant to fire (nothing to burn) but is weak to Acid.
- A Jelly is succeptable to Lightning, but resistant to Acid. 
- Etc...

This way, your not just playing any card and winning, there is some trial and error.

Combat will be Turn Based, as in you perform an action and then the enemy performs an action.
